  <hr />
  <p>
  I’m Kristy Thompson, a former teacher turned passionate web developer, with a coding journey that began in a creative, collaborative online environment where my friends and I brainstormed, researched, and tackled projects together. This collaborative spirit continues to fuel my love for coding, as I’ve learned that teamwork is just as important as individual skills for success. What started as a hobby has evolved into a deep passion for web development. To accelerate my growth, I enrolled in the University of Denver’s Coding Bootcamp, gaining the tools and knowledge needed to tackle real-world challenges as a full-stack developer. Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking with my three rescue dogs, reading across genres, traveling with friends, and capturing my adventures through photography.
